%c%AMD Application Power Management

* Recent AMD Family 15h processors 
  report 'Current Power In Watts' 
  via Processor Power in the TDP MSR

* Support for this can be provided 
  similar to RAPL

* We just need an Interlagos system 
  where someone gives us read 
  permissions to /dev/cpu/*/msr
