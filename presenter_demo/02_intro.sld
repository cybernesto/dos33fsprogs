%c%Energy/Power Measurement is Already 
%c%Possible

Three common ways of doing this:

* Hand-instrumenting a system by 
  tapping all power inputs to CPU, 
  memory, disk, etc., and using a 
  data logger
  
* Using a pass-through power meter 
  that you plug your server into.
  Often these will log over USB
      
* Estimating power/energy with a 
  software model based on
  system behavior
